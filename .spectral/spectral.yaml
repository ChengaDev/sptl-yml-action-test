reporter:

    outputs:
        stylish: {}         # nice looking CLI reports
        # stylish: { html: "output.html" }  # produce HTML reports

        # log: {}          # Just timestamped logs of results

#
# Ignoring Matches
#
# you can specify ignores for matches that you know exist
# and acknowledge them, but you don't care about them for now.
#
# Everything is a regex, you can use any or all of the fields:
# rule_id, rule_name, match_text, path.
#
# To get a fingerprint, run `spectral fingerprint --text YOUR-SECRET`
#
#
# Uncomment the following to activate:
#
# match_ignores:
#     ignores:
#     - match_text: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
#     - match_line_text: dev_value.*
#     - rule_id: <rule id>
#       rule_name: <rule name>
#       match_text: <match text>
#       path: <path>
#       match_fingerprint: 79cdb7f2e0e4a96520304ff641f45f230be4f362a4a16c704730115a85fa545f
